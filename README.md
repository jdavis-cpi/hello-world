# hello-world
Dang I logged into github.
This is a hello-world training session repository. I have created this github user to gain access to my copmany's codebase. 
In fact I have wanted to try this since learning about github but I didn't have a project. Now I are a programmer.
I am a concumate tinkerer. I make projects for fun and for work. At the moment I have 3 thing cooking. At work I am making a 
tester that controls fans and a tester for a PCBA that is an ethernet switch. At home I am going to upgrade a Fluke Scopemeter 
with 18650 Li-ion batteries there is no coding required for this one.
